        <b>The World Wid Web</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web uses a computer language called <em><b>HTML</em></b> which is short
        for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. The main type of document that's on the
        web is actually <em>HTML</em>, so we know that this is important. There are
        many different file types within the web; these include <em>plain text, HTML,
        images, video,</em> and <em>music</em>. There are also some major pieces of
        the web: <em>you, the browser, internet,</em> and <em>the servers</em>.
        <em>HTTP</em> is the protocol of the web. The <em>browser</em> is the program
        that runs to display files on the web. <em>Internet</em> is the computer
        network. <em>Servers</em> are the computers that do the hosting of the files.

        <b>Summary</b> - There are many different pieces of the web including the internet
        , servers, HTTP and the browser. HTML communicates with these as well as all
        different file types.

        <b>HTML Basics</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>HTML</b> is made up of <em>text content</em>, which is what you see. It also
        contains <em>markup</em>, which is what it looks like. There are also references
        to <em>other documents</em>, which can be, for example, images and video.
        <b>HTML</b> markup is made up of tags, and these are incredibly important. <br>
        <b>Summary</b> - HTML is the structure of the web.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--second concept ends, and the third one begins -->
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The way tags are structured is they start with a less than symbal (<) followed
        by the tag name, a greater than symbol (>), the tag contents (those can also
        be other tags) or it could be text, another less than symbol (<), a slash (/),
        the name, and finally another greater than symbol (>). So there is essentially
        an opening tag, the contents, and a closing tag. The whole thing combined
        is called an <em>element</em>. I won't go over how to use the <em>bold</em> and
        <em>emphasis</em> tags because I'm using them in these notes. There's also the
        <em>anchor</em> element which allows you to input links (hyperlinks) easily.
        It is important to keep in mind that computers are very literal, so always be
        looking for typos and small mistakes. For example, if you leave an emphasis tag
        open and forget to close it, then everything after the emphasis tag will
        be emphasized instead of just the words or phrases that you want.<br>
        <b>Summary</b> - The whole tag is called an element, and there's a wide range
        of tags that you can use.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--third concept ends, and fourth begins -->
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Void Tag, Inline, and Block Elements</b> (and what they mean)
      </p>
      <p>
        Up next we have the <em>image</em> tag. This looks like this: <img src="url" alt="text">.
        The words "text" appear because I didn't input the url of the image. Keep in mind that images <b><em>do not</b></em> have a closing tag.
        This is called a <em>void tag</em>. A <em>void tag</em> is a tag that doesn't
        have content, so it <em><b>does not</em></b> need a closing tag. Keep in
        mind that images appear in line with text. When you use the <em>break</em> tag
        that is called <b>inline</b>. This just means that the line ends, and the next
        character wraps around to the next line. The <em>paragraph</em> tag works
        differently. This is a <b>block</b> element. The paragraph tag essentially makes
        an "invisible" box. This "invisible" box can have height and width, where
        <b>inline</b> elements are <b>JUST</b> text. There's also the <em>span</em>
        and <em>div</em> elements. The only difference between them is that span is
        inline, and div is block. Those two elements don't do anything other than just
        contain their content. A <em>div</em> element looks something like this:
        &lt;div class="North Korea"&gt;America&lt;/div&gt;. This creates an invisible box. Span does
        the same thing if you use a "class" except it doesn't create an invisible box.
        Both of these elements have an attribute called <em>classes</em> in this case.
        . Classes are names that you can give to an element.<br>
        <b>Summary</b> - A void tag yields no content, so it doesn't need a closing
        tag. Inline tags are just lines, so when the line ends the next character
        wraps around. Block tags/elements create an invisible box around the content that
        has height and width, whereas inline elements are just text. Div element is block
        and span element is inline. Those two elements only contain their content. Those
        two elements also have an attribute called classes and those contain whatever
        you put inside of them.

        <b>Classes, Document Structure</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes are important in <b>CSS</b>. <b>CSS</b> is a separate language that adds
        style to your documents/webpages. Up next we have <b><em>HTML Document Structure</b></em>
        . First there's the <em>DOCTYPE</em>. The DOCTYPE is HTML. Next we have the
        <em>opening HTML tag</em> and the <em>closing HTML tag</em>. This surrounds the
        rest of the document. Next there's the <em>head</em>. What this contains is
        metadata and other random things. If we included <b>CSS, Javascript, etc</b>
        that would be included in the <em>head</em>. There's also the <em>title</em>.
        The <em>title</em> is the title of the page which appears at the top of the
        browser window/tab. Next there is the <em>body</em> tag. This contains the
        contents of the document.

        <b>Summary</b> - Classes are important in CSS (CSS is a separate language that
        adds style to the web page). HTML Document Structure is important. This includes
        the DOCTYPE, opening HTML tag, closing HTML tag, head (includes metadata, CSS
        , Javascript, etc), title, and the body.
